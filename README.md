# Data Science for Beginners – Personal Fork

This repository is my personal fork of Microsoft's **Data Science for Beginners** open-source curriculum.

## Purpose
I am using this project to build a strong foundation in data science, including:
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Basic statistics
- Working with real datasets in Python

I am documenting my learning progress and adding my own notes, code, and explanations as I complete each lesson.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub

## Progress
- [ ] Introduction to Data Science
- [ ] Data Visualization
- [ ] Data Cleaning
- [ ] Statistics for Data Science

(Updated as I progress)

## What I’m Learning
- How to explore and clean data
- How to visualize trends and patterns
- How to think like a data scientist when solving problems
- How to work with open-source projects and version control
